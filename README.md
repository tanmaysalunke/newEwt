The E-waste Tracker (Pilot Case: Laptops) was created as part of Bachelor of Engineering Final Year Project.
It was created keeping the governement policies about e-waste management in check. It can identify which party was last responsible for storage or safe disposal of e-waste generated by laptops and their parts.
